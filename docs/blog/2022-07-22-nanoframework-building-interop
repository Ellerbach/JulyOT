# Building .NET nanoFramework and interoperability

You can build your own image for an MCU with .NET nanoFramework. For most normal usage, you won't need that. That's already done for you with images for the most popular boards and the ESP32 including advance ones like the M5Stack ones having dedicated images to support their screens.

In case you may need native interop, you'll have to rebuild the image to add in it the needed C/C++ code and expose it properly: <https://jsimoesblog.wordpress.com/2018/06/19/interop-in-net-nanoframework/>. The mechanism is made easy for developers, stubs are built for you (<https://docs.nanoframework.net/content/architecture/nanoclr-stub-args.html>)when building the C\# side of the code and you'll basically will have to copy/paste the generated C++ and headers to your code and add your native part.

While there are many platforms and MCU supported, .NET nanoFramework offers Dev Containers to make is faster and easier: <https://docs.nanoframework.net/content/building/using-dev-container.html>

If you prefer not to use them, it's possible as well and the PR requirements and build options and all what you need is documented as well: <https://docs.nanoframework.net/content/building/index.html>
