We can't believe it's already the last week of June!! Wait - you know what that means right?

Clear up your cables, dust off your Raspberry Pi, dig our your Arduino board, fire up Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO, or the Arduino IDE, and login to the cloud! It's almost time to celebrate the Internet of Things, one thing at a time!

As always #JulyOT will be kicking off on the 1st July, and every day we will be bringing you some awesome IoT content to get you excited about the Internet of Things.

We'll have a mix of live streams, videos, blog posts and code samples, all grouped into the following themes:

* Beginners, makers, and students
* Embedded development
* AI on the Edge
* Learning and certifications

We invite everyone to build and share your creations throughout month as you gain knowledge from these and other resources throughout #JulyOT!  Be sure to spread the word about this initiative and your own projects by sharing the hashtag #JulyOT on social media! We'll be sharing our favorite projects that we find.
