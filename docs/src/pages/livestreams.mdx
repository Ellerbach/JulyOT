Reactors are community spaces where technology professionals meet, learn, and connect - to both their local peers as well as industry-leading ideas and technology from Microsoft, partners, and the open source community. With a diverse mix of workshops, presentations, and networking events customized for each city, there’s something for everyone – whether you’re just getting started or working on complex projects. Our programming is always free and inclusive of a broad set of products, tools, and technologies.
